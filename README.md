# NameThatSong

**NameThatSong** is a fun and interactive game web page where players test their music knowledge by guessing the currently playing song. Users need to connect their Spotify account to enhance the experience, as the project leverages **Spotify's Web API** to search for artists, retrieve song information, and play music directly from Spotify.

This project is a fork of the skeleton framework **[GoTTH](https://github.com/TomDoesTech/GOTTH)**, which serves as the foundation for this application.

## Tech Stack

The project is built using a combination of technologies:

- **Go**: Backend development and core logic  
- **Htmx**: Web interaction  
- **Templ**: Build HTML/X with Go  
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling
